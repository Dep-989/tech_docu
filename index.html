            Welcome to your complete guide to documenting Python code. Whether you’re documenting a small script or a large project, whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned Pythonista, this guide will cover everything you need to know. We’ve broken up this tutorial into four major sections:

        <article>
          <p>
            When you write code, you write it for two primary audiences: your users and your developers (including yourself). Both audiences are equally important. If you’re like me, you’ve probably opened up old codebases and wondered to yourself, “What in the world was I thinking?” If you’re having a problem reading your own code, imagine what your users or other developers are experiencing when they’re trying to use or contribute to your code.
            </p>
            <p>
             In this guide, you’ll learn from the ground up how to properly document your Python code from the smallest of scripts to the largest of Python projects to help prevent your users from ever feeling too frustrated to use or contribute to your project.

        <article>
          <p>
            Before we can go into how to document your Python code, we need to distinguish documenting from commenting. 
            In general, commenting is describing your code to/for developers. The intended main audience is the maintainers and developers of the Python code. In conjunction with well-written code, comments help to guide the reader to better understand your code and its purpose and design.
            </p>
            <p>
            Documenting code is describing its use and functionality to your users. While it may be helpful in the development process, the main intended audience is the users. The following section describes how and when to comment your code.

      <section class="main-section" id="Basics_of_Commenting_Code">
        <header>Basics of Commenting Code</header>
        <article>
          <p>Comments are created in Python using the pound sign (#) and should be brief statements no longer than a few sentences. Here’s a simple example:
          <code>
            def hello_world():
     # A simple comment preceding a simple print statement
     print("Hello World")
     </code>
     </p>
     </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Commenting_Code_via_Type_Hinting">
        <header>Commenting Code via Type Hinting</header>
        <article>
          <p>
          Type hinting was added to Python 3.5 and is an additional form to help the readers of your code. In fact, it takes Jeff’s fourth suggestion from above to the next level. It allows the developer to design and explain portions of their code without commenting. Here’s a quick example:
          <code>
            def hello_name(name: str) -&gt; str:
     return(f"Hello {name}")
     </code>
     </p>
     <p>
     From examining the type hinting, you can immediately tell that the function expects the input name to be of a type str, or string. You can also tell that the expected output of the function will be of a type str, or string, as well. While type hinting helps reduce comments, take into consideration that doing so may also make extra work when you are creating or updating your project documentation.

      <section class="main-section" id="Docstrings_Background">
        <header>Docstrings Background</header>
        <article>
          Documenting your Python code is all centered on docstrings. These are built-in strings that, when configured correctly, can help your users and yourself with your project’s documentation. Along with docstrings, Python also has the built-in function help() that prints out the objects docstring to the console. Here’s a quick example:
          <code>
            &gt;&gt;&gt; help(str)
 Help on class str in module builtins:

 class str(object)
 |  str(object='') -&gt; str
 |  str(bytes_or_buffer[, encoding[, errors]]) -&gt; str
 |
 |  Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or
 |  errors are specified, then the object must expose a data buffer
 |  that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler.
 |  Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined)
 |  or repr(object).
 |  encoding defaults to sys.getdefaultencoding().
 |  errors defaults to 'strict'.
 # Truncated for readability
 </code>
 How is this output generated? Since everything in Python is an object, you can examine the directory of the object using the dir() command. Let’s do that and see what find:
 <code>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; dir(str)
 ['__add__', ..., '__doc__', ..., 'zfill'] # Truncated for readability
 </code>
 </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Docstring_Types">
        <header>Docstring Types</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Docstring conventions are described within PEP 257. Their purpose is to provide your users with a brief overview of the object. They should be kept concise enough to be easy to maintain but still be elaborate enough for new users to understand their purpose and how to use the documented object.
            </p>
            <p>
              In all cases, the docstrings should use the triple-double quote (""") string format. This should be done whether the docstring is multi-lined or not. At a bare minimum, a docstring should be a quick summary of whatever is it you’re describing and should be contained within a single line:
              <code>
                """This is a quick summary line used as a description of the object."""
                </code>
                </p>
                <p>
            Multi-lined docstrings are used to further elaborate on the object beyond the summary. All multi-lined docstrings have the following parts:
            <ul>
            <li>A one-line summary line</li>
            <li>A blank line proceeding the summary</li>
            <li>Any further elaboration for the docstring</li>
            <li>Another blank line</li>
            <li>All docstrings should have the same max character length as comments (72 characters).</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

        <article>
          <p>
            Private projects are projects intended for personal use only and generally aren’t shared with other users or developers. Documentation can be pretty light on these types of projects. Remember, even though private projects are intended for you personally, you are also considered a user. Think about anything that may be confusing to you down the road and make sure to capture those in either comments, docstrings, or the readme.

        <header>Where Do I Start?</header>
        <article>
          <p>The documentation of projects have a simple progression:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>No Documentation</li>
            <li>Some Documentation</li>
            <li>Complete Documentation</li>
            <li>Good Documentation</li>
            <li>Great Documentation</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you’re at a loss about where to go next with your documentation, look at where your project is now in relation to the progression above. Do you have any documentation? If not, then start there. If you have some documentation but are missing some of the key project files, get started by adding those.</p>
            <p>In the end, don’t get discouraged or overwhelmed by the amount of work required for documenting code. Once you get started documenting your code, it becomes easier to keep going. Feel free to comment if you have questions or reach out to the Real Python Team on social media, and we’ll help.</p>
